The website will consist of:​

a home page​
a page detailing the mammals​
a page details the birds​
a page detailing the reptiles

Page Structure:

Each page should have a header with a logo​
Each page should have a navigational menu with links to “home”, "birds", "mammals" and "reptiles". ​
Each page should have a footer with some content.​
Each page should have a side bar and a main content area – the content of both of these areas will be different for each page, but the page layouts should be similar

Home Page:

Sidebar​

Shows a list with the names of all the animals​

Main content:​

On page load shows a welcome message​
When an animal name in the sidebar is clicked, the welcome message is replaced with a short summary of that animal​
A “Read More” button is displayed after the short summary, clicking it leads to the “animal detail"
If the “active” animal's name is clicked again, it is no longer active, and the “welcome” message is displayed
Only one animal can be active at a time

Short summary of an animal consists of:​

a small image of the animal​
the name of the animal​
the first 200 characters of the description (or a similar solution)​
what the animal eats​
which group it belongs to WITH a link to the group page (eg mammal, bird or reptile)
Clicking on Read More button for any animal on the home page should show all the animal details

Animal Details
Style as a pop up or some such - it should fill the entire screen except the header
Show the full summary of the animal
Show a "Close” button to return to the previous view
Note: it is not required, but it is entirely acceptable to use dynamic routing to show this as a separate page. We will cover dynamic routing in the next subject, but if you like a challenge you are free to explore it here

Group Pages:

Sidebar​

show the animal names that are in the group ONLY. You should NOT have birds on the reptile page​

Main content:​

Show a message about that group type
When an animal name is clicked show the full summary of the animal
The full summary should show all the properties of an animal. How you choose to display the information is up to you, but all of it must be shown
